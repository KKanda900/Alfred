# Alfred ü§µ

## Inspiration
My main inspiration for this project was the character Alfred from the Batman series. In the series Alfred is a very useful character to Batman in every way. From making his food to getting him the specific weapons he needs for any battle. So I thought that a voice assistant that can replicate his usefulness in people's everyday lives would be very ideal instead of the useless voice assistants like **cough cough** Siri.

## What it does
It is a voice assistant that will help you with your everyday tasks that has the capabilities to understand what you are saying completely. It will help you do tasks that need to be done like jotting down important information, help you with cooking, and in general help you with any task that you throw at it.

## How I built it
The tools I used to complete this project is using Python for the back-end and ElectronJS framework for the front-end of this project. Also implemented Google's text to speech API to translate audio to text and Python's Natural Language Toolkit to process input from the user.

## Challenges I ran into
Major challenge I ran into at first was thinking of the approach because in the Batman series, he is one of the main people that helps Batman so thinking of a voice assistant that can replicate that would be tough.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud that I can say I made my voice assistance with a flair. Also, that I made a voice assistant for desktop users because we know not everyone likes Cortona. üòù
