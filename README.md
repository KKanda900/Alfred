# Alfred

## Inspiration
My main inspiration for this project was the character Alfred from the Batman series. In the series Alfred is a very useful character to Batman in every way. From making his food to getting him the specific weapons he needs for any battle. So I thought that a voice assistant that can replicate his usefulness in people's everyday lives would be very ideal instead of the useless voice assistants like **cough cough** Siri.

## What it does
It is a voice assistant that will help you with your everyday tasks that has the capabilities to understand what you are saying completely. It will do tasks from telling you the weather to writing down your to do for the day.

## How I built it
The tools I used to complete this project is using Python for the back-end and ElectronJS framework for the front-end of this project.

## Challenges I ran into
Nothing major just a few compilation errors here and there.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud that I can say I made my voice assistance with a flair. Also, that I made a voice assistant for desktop users because we know not everyone likes Cortona. üòù
